# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
My Getting And Cleaning Data Project (coursera Data Science Course)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The delivery files are as follows:
1) a tidy data set as described below --> The file "mean_by_subject_Activity_df.txt" was created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE  and was uploaded as a txt file to coursera site (also loaded to GitHub)
2) a link to a Github repository with my R script --> run_analysis.R,  which is performing the analysis.
3) a code book --> CodeBook.md , that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data 
4) This README.md is also part of the GitHub repo
